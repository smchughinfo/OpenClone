- Massive project refactor in progress:
  * Directory structure changed: 
    - 'website' previously called 'OpenClone'
    - 'OpenClone' is now the root directory
    - 'databaserestore' renamed to 'database'
    - 'StartStopScripts' previously inside Website
  * Container naming convention: all project containers prefixed with 'openclone-'
    - Examples: openclone-website, openclone-SadTalker, openclone-U-2-Net, openclone-CICD
  * Anticipating potential issues during project revival
